Performance Monitor Analyzer v1.10    updated by StevePar@microsoft.com

Added UAC elevation to enable writes to the registry on UAC enabled OS’s.  Another limitation I found was that you could not run two PMA summaries at the same time.  I have corrected that also, but keep in mind that running multiple instances concurrently will chew up quite a bit of CPU time

Performance Monitor Analyzer v1.00

Author: Jeff Fanjoy, VMC Consulting (v-11jfan / JeffreyFan@vmc.com)

Many thanks to Austin Mack (austinm@microsoft.com) and Yong Rhee (yongrhee@microsoft.com)
for their assistance testing and making recommendations.  Without their help and support
this script would not be anywhere near what it is today!


Purpose:
========
This script is intended to provide a high level summary of key counters utilized by the
Performance team.  Reviewing Perfmons has long been time consuming in attempting to collect
data on items such as which process is the reason for a handle leak.  In addition it has
always been time consuming to generate a report that is meaningful to both customers and
other individuals reviewing a case.

***** THIS SCRIPT IS NOT INTENDED TO REPLACE ANALYSIS OF A PERFORMANCE MONITOR LOG *****

My hope is that this script will alleviate the time consuming aspects of analyzing a perfmon
log and quickly identifying areas that should be have focus when performing the analysis.


Installation:
=============
1.  Double-click the pma.vbs script to install the PerfFile handler context menu entry.
2.  When prompted, select your desired default options

    * = Select all options

    Summary Options
    ---------------
       M = Memory Totals
       P = Processor Totals
       D = Physical Disk Totals
       N = Network Interface Totals
       T = Terminal Server Session Totals

    Process Options
    ---------------
       H = Top 10 Processes by Handle Count
       S = Top 10 Processes by Thread Count
       B = Top 10 Processes by Private Bytes
       V = Top 10 Processes by Virtual Bytes
       W = Top 10 Processes by Working Set
       C = Top 10 Processes by % Processor Time
       I = Top 10 Processes by IO Data Bytes/sec

    Examples
    --------
       MPDN         = Memory, Processor, Disk and NIC Summary only
       MPDNTHSBVWCI = Everything (same as *)
       HSBVWCI      = Top 10 Processes only
       MPDH         = Memory, Processor, Disk and Top 10 by Handles


Usage:
======
1.  Execute script either by Context Menu or from command prompt.
    
    Context Menu
    ------------
    Right-click any BLG or CSV file and select the "Open With Performance Monitor 
    Analyzer" context menu option to begin analysis.


    Command Prompt
    --------------
    cscript "x:\fullpath\pma.vbs" "x:\fullpath\perfmonlog.blg"


2.  When prompted select processing options for this run (default will be set
    to options provided during installation - see step 2 in Installation for
    details of what each option does).


Processed Data
==============
Processed data is left behind in the %TEMP% folder.  This folder is typically located
in the user profile (C:\Documents and Settings\username\Local Settings\Temp).

The files left behind will be overwritten with each processing of a Performance
Monitor log.  The files are:

pma_counters.$$$      The counters that were requested from the Perfmon log
pma_outputfile.$$$    The CSV output from relog.exe processing
pma_processlog.$$$    A history of everything displayed to the cscript window
pma_resultsfile.$$$   Results text file- only created if writing to the folder with 
                      the Perfmon log fails


Known Issues
============
1.  Relog.exe has known issues across a UNC and as a result sometimes will fail when
    attempting to process a log across a UNC.  Copying the file to a local hard disk
    will generally mitigate this.

2.  Relog.exe will sometimes produce output that has numerous problems including samples
    out of order and missing samples.  There is nothing that can be done about this
    but fortunately it doesn't occur often.  This script is a garbage in garbage out
    processing of relog.exe data, so if the data is bad, the script won't know the
    difference, although attempts are made to mitigate this as it processes.

3.  The script assumes that a log file was generated on an English localized OS.  Any
    log file generated on a non-English localized OS should process correctly however
    it will not process any of the counters since the script will be looking for the
    counter names in English only.  Handling localized languages other than English is
    being considered for the next major version of the script depending on demand for
    such a feature.

4.  While the script is running it calls relog.exe (included with the OS) to convert 
    the .BLG performance log file into a .CSV file format that can be read by  VBS 
    script.  On occasion relog.exe takes a while to convert a file to .CSV format.  
    The time taken by relog.exe and the time taken by VBS script are noted at the 
    bottom of the output file.  The script runs at below normal priority as to not 
    affect the performance of the system while running.  Script will work on W2K if
    relog.exe is copied from WinXP or W2K3

Areas to Investigate
====================
   \Memory\Pages/sec
        [Min: 11.402, Max: 1,083.929, Avg: 112.9]
             - High values (~500) may be fine if disk subsystem is fast.
             - Review % Idle Time and Avg. Disk sec/Transfer for I/O rates.

   \PhysicalDisk(0 C:)\Split IO/Sec
        [Min: 0, Max: 39.227, Avg: 2.021]
             - Split IO operations make up 8.04% of Disk Transfers.
             - Avg should be extremely close to 0.000.
             - RAID may be too small/NTFS block too small.
             - Disk may have moderate to heavy fragmentation.

   \Process(_Total)\Handle Count
        [Min: 40,942, Max: 46,781, Avg: 43,797]
             - This may be a normal amount on Terminal Servers in Application Mode.
             - Investigate individual applications using > 1,500 handles.

   \Process(_Total)\Thread Count
        [Min: 2,050, Max: 2,198, Avg: 2,153]
             - This may be a normal amount on Terminal Servers in Application Mode.
             - Investigate individual applications using > 150 threads.

   \Processor(0)\% Processor Time
        [Min: 23.75%, Max: 100%, Avg: 75.53%]
             - Check individual processes for high usage.

   \Processor(1)\% Processor Time
        [Min: 18.75%, Max: 100%, Avg: 73.32%]
             - Check individual processes for high usage.
